    "Q1.  What is the relationship between polynomial functions and kernel functions in machine learning algorithms?\n",

    "ANS- Polynomial functions and kernel functions are both used in machine learning algorithms to map data into a higher dimensional space. \n",
    "     This allows the algorithms to learn more complex relationships between the data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polynomial functions are a type of mathematical function that can be used to represent the relationship between two or more variables. \n",
    "They are often used in machine learning algorithms because they are relatively easy to understand and interpret.\n",

    "Kernel functions are a type of function that can be used to map data into a higher dimensional space. They are often used in machine \n",
    "learning algorithms because they can represent more complex relationships between the data points than polynomial functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between polynomial functions and kernel functions is that polynomial functions can be used to define kernel functions. \n",
    "For example, the Gaussian kernel is a common kernel function that can be defined as a polynomial function of the Euclidean distance between \n",
    "two data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning algorithms, polynomial functions and kernel functions are often used together. The polynomial function is used to \n",
